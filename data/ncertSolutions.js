          "answer": "Fizzing will occur more vigorously in test tube A because HCl is a strong acid and ionises completely, producing more H⁺ ions.

          "answer": "The Salt March of 1930, led by Gandhiji, was a pivotal moment in India's struggle for independence. Gandhiji and his followers marched 240 miles to the coastal town of Dandi to produce salt, defying British salt laws that imposed a monopoly on salt production. This act of defiance became a powerful symbol of resistance because it targeted a fundamental and widely felt colonial injustice and mobilized millions of Indians across the country."

          "answer": "Rice requires a warm, tropical or subtropical climate with temperatures between 25-35°C for optimal growth. It needs heavy, well-distributed rainfall or access to irrigation, as it thrives in flooded fields, known as paddies. Rice grows best in regions with fertile alluvial soils, which provide essential nutrients for the crop. A flat terrain with good water retention is ideal for cultivating rice, as it requires standing water during the growing season. Major rice-producing regions in India include West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, and Tamil Nadu, where the monsoon climate provides the necessary conditions for rice cultivation."

Define the terms used in this definition that you feel are necessary. Are there any undefined terms in this? Can you justify that all sides and all angles are equal in an equilateral triangle?",
            "answer": "Hence, an equilateral triangle is a type of polygon. A polygon is a closed figure formed by line segments. The term 'equal' refers to two or more things being the same in measurement. An undefined term in this definition is 'point,' as it is used to define a line segment. Hence, in an equilateral triangle, all three sides are of equal length, and all angles are equal to 60° because the sum of the internal angles of a triangle is always 180°.

The rich often have more opportunities to influence political decisions, while the poor are underrepresented in politics.

This inequality impacts policies on education, healthcare, and job opportunities, making it harder for the poor to escape poverty.
