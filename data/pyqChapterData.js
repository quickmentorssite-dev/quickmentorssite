          "answer": "This confirms Mendel’s Law of Segregation. In F1, all plants were heterozygous tall (Tt). When self-pollinated, the F2 generation showed a 3:1 ratio of tall to short, revealing the presence of recessive traits that were masked in F1."

          "question": "Why it happened? Explain briefly. (2021-22)",
          "answer": "It happened because traits are governed by pairs of alleles—one from each parent. In the F1 generation, the dominant allele (T for tallness) masks the recessive one (t for dwarfness), so all plants appear tall. However, in the F2 generation, allele segregation allows tt combinations, causing the dwarf trait to reappear. This demonstrates Mendel’s law of segregation."

In the F2 generation, new combinations such as round green and wrinkled yellow appeared, which weren’t seen in parent plants.

Moreover, people’s habit of ignoring traffic rules only worsens the situation. The need of the hour is to promote public transport, carpooling, and better road planning.
